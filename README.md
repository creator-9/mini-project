# 💰 MoneyFlow

A streamlined personal finance tool designed for **effortless  track of expenses** and **intuitive visualization**. It helps users control overspending and understand their financial habits without the complexity of traditional apps or spreadsheets.

## 🧠 Project Motivation

Many financial apps feel overly complex and tedious, requiring constant navigation and form-filling. This makes it difficult for users (especially students and early professionals) to maintain consistency in logging data.

We aimed to build a **minimal, intuitive interface** that focuses purely on **rapid data entry** and **clear, immediate financial insights**, making consistent tracking accessible to everyone.

## 🌟 What the App Does

### ✔ Effortless Expense Logging

Users can quickly log expenses using a single, simple input form, requiring only the **amount, category, and date**. The design prioritizes **minimal clicks** for fast data submission.

### ✔ Real-Time Spending Feedback

The dashboard instantly updates upon every entry, providing **clear, visual warnings** and suggestions if the user's spending approaches or exceeds a set category budget limit.

### ✔ Simple Dashboard for Insights

The core UI is a clean dashboard that presents data visually for easy comprehension:
* Category-wise spending breakdown (Pie Chart)
* Weekly/monthly spending trends (Bar Chart)
* Budget progress indicators

### ✔ Personalized Budget Setup

The initial setup process guides the user through defining their custom budget by setting their **income, financial goals, and specific spending categories**.

## 🧱 Tech Stack (Frontend Only)

* **HTML** — Provides the essential structure for all components, including the streamlined expense entry form and the visualization dashboard layout.
* **CSS** — Used to create a modern, clean, and highly scannable visual design, emphasizing data clarity and user experience.
* **JavaScript** — Manages all client-side logic, including form handling, state management for expenses, calculating budget figures, and rendering the dynamic charts and visual feedback.

> **Note:** This is a **frontend-only project**. The focus is on the user interface, interaction design, and client-side logic for data input and visualization. Data persistence and complex rule processing are simulated or assumed to be handled by a theoretical external service.
