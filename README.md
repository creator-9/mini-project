💰 MoneyFlow
A streamlined personal finance tool designed for effortless track of expenses and intuitive visualization to help users track spending, control overspending, and understand their financial habits.

💡 Project Motivation
Many financial apps are overly complex, making it difficult for users (especially students and early professionals) to consistently log data. We aimed to build a highly intuitive and minimal interface that focuses purely on rapid data entry and clear, immediate financial insights.

MoneyFlow prioritizes simplicity and speed over complex features, making consistent tracking accessible to everyone.

✨ What MoneyFlow Does ?

✔ Effortless Expense Logging Users can quickly log expenses using a simple, dedicated form/input field, requiring only the amount, category, and date. The focus is on minimal clicks and fast data submission.

✔ Real-Time Spending Feedback The dashboard instantly updates upon entry, providing clear, visual warnings and suggestions if a user's spending approaches or exceeds a set category budget limit.

✔ Simple Dashboard for Insights The core of the application is the dashboard, which presents data visually for easy comprehension:

Category-wise spending breakdown (Pie Chart)

Weekly/monthly spending trends (Bar Chart)

Budget progress indicators

✔ Personalized Budget Setup The initial setup process guides the user through setting up their custom budget by defining income, financial goals, and specific spending categories.

🧱 Tech Stack (Frontend Only)
HTML — Provides the structure for all components, including the expense entry form and the visualization dashboard. 

CSS — Used to create a modern, clean, and highly scannable visual design, emphasizing data clarity and user experience. 

JavaScript — Manages all client-side logic, including form handling, state management for expenses, calculating budget figures, and rendering the dynamic charts and visual feedback.

Note: This is a **frontend-only **project. The focus is on the user interface, interaction design, and client-side logic for data input and visualization. Data persistence and complex rule processing are simulated or assumed to be handled by a theoretical external service.

🎯 Why We Built It
Speed of Entry: We designed a process that is faster than traditional spreadsheets or complex apps.

Visual Clarity: Immediate visual feedback helps users correct habits and understand their finances at a glance.

Minimalist UI: The distraction-free interface focuses purely on the essential task of tracking and reviewing financial data.

Accessibility: Using standard web technologies ensures the application is fast, lightweight, and accessible.

📌 Current Status
The project includes:

A functional interface for quick manual expense entry.

Client-side logic for budget calculation and rendering visual feedback.
